**Shorthand Coursework Specs**

All members must know other members
First member is the host node
All members can only connect by using three parameters (Unique ID, Listening Port, Connecting port and Ip of an existing member)
If host does not respond to a new member, any new member can become the host
Members module should be completely modular and not accept keyboard unput after connection, just print our various information.
Ctrl^C must be used as a quit/close connection button.
All members and messages should be digitally signed and all signatures mst be checked. 
All keys are stored in the Java Key-store.
I believe this is meant to be a command line program but its possible he expects us more to make a program similar to an irc cient.
